\title{Generate Interaction Plot for Two Factors}
\usage{
generate_interaction_plot(int1, int2, df)
}
\arguments{
\item{int1}{The name of the first factor for the interaction plot, corresponding to
column names in the matrix generated by \code{\link{generate_planning_matrix}}
(e.g., "A", "B", "C").}

\item{int2}{The name of the second factor for the interaction plot, similar to int1.}

\item{df}{A data frame containing the data for the ANOVA analysis.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the interaction plot between the two specified factors.
}
\description{
This function creates an interaction plot for two factors using ggplot2. It's useful in
analyzing the interactions between two factors in a multi-factor ANOVA design. The function
relies on \code{\link{generate_planning_matrix}} to determine the factor levels.
}
\note{
The factors int1 and int2 should be named according to the columns generated
by \code{\link{generate_planning_matrix}}, typically "A", "B", "C", etc.
}
\examples{
# Create dummy data for demonstration
set.seed(404) # for reproducibility
dummy_df <- data.frame(A = rnorm(8), B = rnorm(8), C = rnorm(8), D = rnorm(8))

# Generate an interaction plot between factors A and B using dummy data
generate_interaction_plot("A", "B", dummy_df)
